# Room3D
A mess of a 3D Graphics Engine built in Java Swing
***

This project was made as an attempt to build a 3D engine
From the simplest form of Java graphics
It was abandoned in the Spring of 2015, for the code became
too much of a mess and I could not get the cube to move
Feel free to look at it and modify it as much as you want
Also, unintentionally, some of the code for building the 3D cube
and room use a similar method as OpenGL
Please contact me if you actually have gotten the cube to move
This project was intended for personal use and I take no responsiblity
For anything that happens due to executing or using this code in any way.
